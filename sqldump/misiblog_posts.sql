INSERT INTO `posts` VALUES (13,'An AI used art to control monkeys’ brain cells','An-AI-used-art-to-control-monkeys-brain-cells','<p>New artwork created by artificial intelligence does weird things to the primate brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When shown to macaques, AI-generated images purposefully caused nerve cells in the monkeys&rsquo; brains to fire more than pictures of real-world objects. The AI could also design patterns that activated specific neurons while suppressing others, researchers report in the May 3 <em>Science</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aav9436\" target=\"_blank\">unprecedented control over neural activity using images</a> may lead to new kinds of neuroscience experiments or treatments for mental disorders. The AI&rsquo;s ability to play the primate brain like a fiddle also offers insight into how closely AIs can emulate brain function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AI responsible for the new mind-bending images is an artificial neural network &mdash; a computer model composed of virtual neurons &mdash; modeled after the <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-doesn%E2%80%99t-sort-visual-cues-alone\">ventral stream</a>. This is a neural pathway in the brain involved in vision (<em>SN Online: 8/12/09</em>). The AI learned to &ldquo;see&rdquo; by studying a library of about 1.3 million labeled images. Researchers then instructed the AI to design pictures that would affect specific ventral stream neurons in the brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Viewing any image triggers some kind of neural activity in a brain. But neuroscientist Kohitij Kar of MIT and colleagues wanted to see whether the AI&rsquo;s deliberately designed images could induce specific neural responses of the team&rsquo;s choosing. The researchers showed these images to three macaques fitted with neuron-monitoring microelectrodes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one experiment, the AI aimed to create patterns that would activate neurons at a specific site in the ventral stream as much as possible, regardless of how it affected other neurons. In 40 of the 59 neural sites tested, AI-made pictures caused neurons to fire more than any image of a real-world object, such as a bear, a car or a face. The AI&rsquo;s images generally caused neurons to fire 39 percent more than their maximum response to real-world images. Even when the monkeys were shown patterns previously designed by researchers specifically to trigger ventral stream neurons, the AI designs made these neurons fire at higher rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ez egy kép\" class=\"img-fluid img-thumbnail\" src=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/images/050119_mt_ai-neural-response_inline1_730.jpg\" style=\"height:564px; width:730px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In another test, the AI crafted patterns meant to make the neurons at one target site go wild, while minimizing the activity of others. For 25 of 33 sites, AI-created images isolated neural activity to the target site significantly better than real-world images. Although this manipulation is not yet perfect, future AIs with more sophisticated designs and more training data may wield finer control, says study coauthor Pouya Bashivan, a computational neuroscientist at MIT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is magnificent technical progress,&rdquo; says Arash Afraz, a neuroscientist at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., not involved in the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In neuroscience experiments, researchers &ldquo;may want to induce a specific pattern of activity in the brain&rdquo; to learn what different neurons are responsible for, Afraz says. &ldquo;The direct way of doing that is to roll your sleeves up, open up the skull and stick something in there,&rdquo; like electrodes. &ldquo;Now, we have a new tool in our toolbox&rdquo; to noninvasively tinker with neurons in ways that weren&rsquo;t possible before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AI-rendered images that orchestrate neural activity may also lead to new treatments for mental health problems like post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety or &ldquo;anything that would have to do with mood,&rdquo; Bashivan says. Similar to the way that people use <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mood-brighteners-light-therapy-gets-nod-depression-buster?mode=magazine&amp;context=502\">light therapy boxes to assuage seasonal affective disorder</a> (<em>SN: 4/23/05, p. 261</em>) or look at <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/virtual-reality-therapy-has-real-life-benefits-some-mental-disorders\">peaceful nature scenes to calm down</a> (<em>SN: 11/10/18, p. 16</em>), people may someday be soothed by gazing upon images that an AI tailor-made to boost mood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These experiments not only demonstrate a new technique to manipulate neurons, but also provide new insight into the nature of AI. Artificial neural networks are neuroscientists&rsquo; best computer models of the ventral stream. The virtual neurons in these computer programs are arranged a similar architecture as biological ones, and these AIs are great at recognizing objects in photographs. But there&rsquo;s been some debate about how truly brainlike these AIs are, in terms of how they process and understand visual inputs, says Ed Connor, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University not involved in the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that monkey neurons responded to AI-created images just as the AI intended suggests that this computer program does indeed understand visual information in a way that&rsquo;s similar to the primate brain, Connor says. &ldquo;This nails it in a way that will convince skeptics, including myself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If artificial neural networks actually &ldquo;see&rdquo; in a way that closely mimics the brain, studying these AI programs may help scientists better understand human vision. Researchers of the future might forgo monkeys and mice, and probe <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/AI-uses-mammal-brain-wiring-navigate\">neural goings-on inside AIs instead</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/18, p. 14</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experimenting on such virtual neurons could offer &ldquo;a way of letting you do any dream experiment you would like on a system that&rsquo;s completely accessible in a way that the brain isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Connor says.</p>\r\n','ai.jpg','2019-05-05 12:46:07',1,0,NULL,NULL),(14,'How scientists traced a uranium cube to Nazi Germany’s nuclear reactor program','How-scientists-traced-a-uranium-cube-to-Nazi-Germanys-nuclear-reactor-program','<img alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid img-fluid\" src=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2019/04/main/articles/042419_ec_uraniumcube_feat.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>The mysterious cube arrived in the summer of 2013. Physicist Timothy Koeth had agreed to go to a parking lot for an unspecified delivery. Inside a blue cloth sack, swathed in paper towels, he found a small chunk of uranium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was about 5 centimeters across, with &ldquo;a white piece of paper wrapped around it, like a ransom note on a stone,&rdquo; Koeth says. On the paper was a message: &ldquo;Taken from the reactor that Hitler tried to build. Gift of Ninninger.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Koeth, a collector of nuclear memorabilia, was enthralled. &ldquo;I just immediately knew what this thing was,&rdquo; he says. During World War II, German scientists had attempted to build a nuclear reactor, until their uranium cubes &mdash; more than 600 of them &mdash; were confiscated by Allied forces and shipped to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Koeth, of the University of Maryland in College Park, thought his cube could be from that cache but wanted to confirm the hunch. In the process, he and University of Maryland graduate student Miriam Hiebert came to a striking conclusion, reported May 1 in <em>Physics Today</em>: Contrary to conventional wisdom, Germans scientists could have created a nuclear reactor during the war, but competition between teams stymied the effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first clue to the cube&rsquo;s heritage was its surface. Pockmarked with bubbles, it pointed to primitive uranium processing techniques used at the time. Another hint came from the name &ldquo;Ninninger&rdquo; in the note. Some digging revealed that it was the misspelled last name of Robert Nininger, who had been involved with the U.S. wartime effort to build an atomic bomb, known as the Manhattan Project. Nininger&rsquo;s widow confirmed that he once had owned a uranium cube and gave it to a friend. Koeth thinks that the cube changed hands several more times before it eventually came to him. (Its radioactivity levels are low enough that the cube is safe to handle.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"lz-cont\" style=\"float:right\">\r\n<div class=\"inline-image-wrapper\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<strong>CUBE CHRONICLERS</strong> Physicist Timothy Koeth (right) and materials scientist Miriam Hiebert (left) investigated the origins of a block of uranium purportedly from &ldquo;the reactor that Hitler tried to build.&rdquo; Behind them is glassware containing uranium, which glows under ultraviolet light.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"inline-image-caption\">John T. Consoli/Univ. of Maryland</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In a nuclear reactor, atoms split through a process known as fission. Get enough uranium in one place, and the neutrons released in fission can trigger additional fissions, kicking off a continuing chain of reactions that releases energy. Uranium for use in modern nuclear reactors is enriched to contain more of a particular isotope, or variety of the element with a given number of neutrons. That isotope is the one that is important for nuclear fission. But the German reactor attempt used uranium with its naturally existing abundance of isotopes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Koeth and Hiebert measured the energy of gamma rays &mdash; high energy particles of light &mdash; emitted from the cube as the atoms within decay. Those measurements confirmed that the cube was natural, unenriched uranium.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2019/04/main/articles/042419_ec_uraniumcube_inline1_370_REV.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:555px; width:370px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further tests indicated that the cube was never in a working reactor. If it had been, the researchers would have detected gamma rays from the isotope cesium-137. A similar hunk of material taken from the <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/anniversary-first-controlled-nuclear-chain-reaction\">first successful nuclear reactor</a> at the University of Chicago in 1942 did contain the telltale cesium (<em>SN Online: 11/29/17</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers&rsquo; sleuthing also resulted in an unexpected historical find. Modern computer simulations have suggested that the Germans&rsquo; 664-cube uranium stash hadn&rsquo;t been enough for the scientists to create a nuclear reactor. A minimum amount of the element, called a critical mass, is necessary to sustain the chain of reactions that occur in a reactor. To reach that mass, the Germans, working under physicist Werner Heisenberg, would have needed a few hundred additional cubes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as Koeth and Hiebert scoured documents at the National Archives in College Park, the pair found references to another 400 or so cubes held by a different German research group. At the time, German science teams were competing against one another. Had they combined forces, they would have had enough uranium to make a reactor, Koeth and Hiebert determined. The German scientists were still far from producing an atomic bomb, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Koeth eventually plans to loan his cube to a museum. For now, it&rsquo;s ensconced in a custom-built, handheld display case, and is the jewel of Koeth&rsquo;s collection of nuclear artifacts. Those other items include graphite from that first reactor at the University of Chicago, greenish glass from sand fused by an atomic bomb test and uranium-infused glassware known as Vaseline glass that glows green under ultraviolet light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m humbled&rdquo; by the cube, Koeth says. Uranium fuels nuclear power, which could help free humanity from fossil fuel dependence, he says. But the element can also be used in devastating weapons. Nuclear physics &ldquo;has the ability to save us and to totally destroy us. And that little cube represents all of that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pair still want to chase down the remaining cubes from Heisenberg&rsquo;s reactor attempt. They know the whereabouts of 10 others, including one at the Smithsonian Institution based in Washington, D.C., and another at Harvard University. Others are probably scattered around the United States. &ldquo;They could be in people&#39;s basements all over the country,&rdquo; Hiebert says. Perhaps to some, it&rsquo;s just &ldquo; &lsquo;that weird cube that my dad had in his office,&rsquo; &rdquo; she says.</p>\r\n','v.jpg','2019-05-05 12:47:48',1,0,NULL,NULL),(15,'SpaceX Dragon Heads to Space Station with NASA Science, Cargo','SpaceX-Dragon-Heads-to-Space-Station-with-NASA-Science-Cargo','<p>After launching at 2:48 a.m. EDT Saturday, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/spacex\">SpaceX</a>&nbsp;Dragon cargo spacecraft is on its way to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html\">International Space Station</a>&nbsp;with approximately 5,500 pounds of NASA cargo and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/spx17-research\">science investigations</a>&nbsp;that include research into Earth&rsquo;s carbon cycle and the formation of asteroids and comets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/spacex_crs-17_launch.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid img-thumbnail\" src=\"https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/spacex_crs-17_launch-720x405.jpg\" style=\"credits:NASA&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The spacecraft launched on a Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and is scheduled to arrive at the orbiting laboratory on Monday, May 6.
